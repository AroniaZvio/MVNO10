# 🔄 Navigation Changes Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

### Navigation Block Reordering
Updated `web/src/components/DashboardNavigation.tsx` to reorder the navigation items as requested:

**New Order:**
1. **Overview** (📊) - Main dashboard page  

**Removed:**
- **My Numbers** (📱) - Removed from navigation block
- **Profile** (👤) - Removed from navigation block
- **Available Numbers** (🔍) - Removed from navigation block

## 📋 What Was Changed

### Before:
```javascript
const navItems: NavItem[] = [
  { path: '/dashboard', label: 'Overview', ... },
  { path: '/dashboard/profile', label: 'Profile', ... },
  { path: '/dashboard/connected-numbers', label: 'My Numbers', ... },
  { path: '/dashboard/available-numbers', label: 'Available Numbers', ... }
];
```

### After:
```javascript
const navItems: NavItem[] = [
  { path: '/dashboard', label: 'Overview', ... }
];
```

## 🔍 What Remains Intact

- **Routes still exist**: 
  - `/dashboard/connected-numbers` route is still functional
  - `/dashboard/profile` route is still functional
- **Dashboard overview**: "My Numbers" and "Profile" sections still appear on the main dashboard
- **Functionality**: All connected numbers and profile functionality remains available
- **Direct access**: Users can still access "My Numbers" and "Profile" via direct URL or dashboard overview

## 🎯 Result

The navigation block now shows only 1 item:
1. Overview  

The "My Numbers", "Profile", and "Available Numbers" functionality is still accessible through the dashboard overview page, but is no longer displayed as separate navigation items.

## 📱 User Experience

- **Cleaner navigation**: Reduced from 4 to 1 navigation item
- **Simplified interface**: Only Overview remains in navigation
- **Maintained access**: My Numbers, Profile, and Available Numbers are still accessible via the dashboard overview
- **Consistent design**: All styling and functionality remains the same
